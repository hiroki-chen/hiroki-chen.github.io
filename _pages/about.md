About
======
Hello! My name is Haobin Chen(陈豪斌, in Chinsese). I am a third-year undergraduate student at [Nankai University](https://www.nankai.edu.cn), majoring in information security in the [College of Computer Science and Cybersecurity](https://cyber.nankai.edu.cn). After graduation, I am expected to pursue a Ph.D. degree in U.S., working on the research of TEE and system security.

My research interest lies in the area of computer security, cryptography, and system security. I am currently doing research on the following fields:

* Applied Cryptography
* Oblivious RAM
* TEEs (e.g., Intel's SGX, TDX, AMD's SEV, ARM TrustZone)
* Confidential Computing

Selected Works
======

* [FH-CryptDB](https://github.com/hiroki-chen/FH_CryptDB): An encrypted database with frequency-hiding properties.
* [SEAL-SSE](https://github.com/hiroki-chen/SSE-SEAL): Implementation of the paper *SEAL: Attack Mitigation for Encrypted Databases via Adjustable Leakage*.
* [SO2](https://github.com/hiroki-chen/SGXOram): An ORAN based on Intel SGX.
* [ARM-Compiler](https://github.com/hiroki-chen/NKUCompiler): A Bison-based C compiler for ARM-v7 platforms.
