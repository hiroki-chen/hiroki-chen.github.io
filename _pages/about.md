About
======
Hello! My name is Haobin Chen (陈豪斌, in Chinsese). I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at [Nankai University](https://www.nankai.edu.cn), majoring in information security in the [College of Computer Science and Cybersecurity](https://cyber.nankai.edu.cn). Currently I am doing remote internship on some cool stuffs, collbaorating with Hongbo Chen, Dr. Mingshen Sun and Prof. Xiaofeng Wang @ IUB.

My research interests lie in the area of computer security, and system security, especially the intersections of theoretical and practical security. These include:

* (Previously) Applied Cryptography
* (Previously) Oblivious RAM
* **(Currently) TEEs (e.g., Intel's SGX, TDX, AMD's SEV, ARM TrustZone)**
* **(Currently) Confidential Computing and / or (formal) verficiation**

Current Status
======
* Learning Coq
* Writing Rust code
* Working on my personal open-source project
* Working with Hongbo on IEEE SP'23 (Oakland) paper!!!

Selected Works
======

* [FH-CryptDB](https://github.com/hiroki-chen/FH_CryptDB): An encrypted database with frequency-hiding properties.
* [SEAL-SSE](https://github.com/hiroki-chen/SSE-SEAL): Implementation of the paper *SEAL: Attack Mitigation for Encrypted Databases via Adjustable Leakage*.
* [SO2](https://github.com/hiroki-chen/SGXOram): An ORAN based on Intel SGX.
